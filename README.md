# AD8307 RF Wattmeter

I always wanted to build a RF Wattmeter with the AD8307 and OZ2CPU design. I was looking for PIC MCUs and found that PIC16F876 is going to NRND, so after this I found it was the best time to start this project. It's a AD8307 RF Wattmeter from OZ2CPU in a PCB that can be placed on a Hammond 1590B box.
